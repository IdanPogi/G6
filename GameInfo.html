                    Valorant is a team-based first-person tactical hero shooter set in the near future. Players play as one of a set of Agents, characters based on several countries and cultures around the world. In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it.
                    The lore of VALORANT refers to the fictional universe that the game is set in, the histories of its characters and settings, and the stories/narratives that occur within. Each agent in the game has their own backstory, all united together under the VALORANT organizations that the game takes its name from.

                    <br>
                    The central conflict that the organization is a part of is reflected in VALORANT's core gameplay (one team seeking to detonate a spike and steal surrounding radianite, the other defending their homeland), but the games and round-by-round fights played by players are not canon themselves and have no effect on the lore.
                    The VALORANT Protocol is the secretive organization that VALORANT revolves around. Made up of multiple agents from around the world, they have been tasked with defending their home against mysterious assailants from another, yet familiar, world.
